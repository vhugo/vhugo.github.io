For starter, I wanted to keep my dev env isolated and more controlled, reason why I opt to use Docker, I had it already installed, as well as Ruby and Rails.
I created the new project with rails new --skip-bundle gallery on my workstation, used --skip-bundle because I'm going to install all Gems in the container, it added all the files and folder I needed to start my Rails project, then I added everything into a Git repository, just to keep track of my steps.</description></item></channel></rss>
