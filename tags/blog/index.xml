Last time I decided to create anything like a blog it was 1999. I'm used to work with dynamic webpages with database access upon request, since 1999 websites development has changed from static files only to dynamic webpages and now it's coming back to static file again, to improve user experience by being as fast as it can possibly be.</description></item></channel></rss>
