<h1 id="this-is-a-collection-of-thoughts-and-experiences">This is a
collection of thoughts and experiences</h1>
<p>This is a never-ending, working in progress personal website. The
idea is to have a place where I can quietly share projects, ideas and
experiments. Sort of the best proof I can have I exist.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito,_ergo_sum" target="_blank">Cogito, ergo sum</a></p>
<p>This is my latest attempt to make and maintain a personal website.
Many attempts came before that and I don’t believe this will be the
last. This time, I was highly inspired by
<a href="https://www.xxvvii.com" target="_blank">Devine Lu Linvega</a>
and even more so by the people in the
<a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/" target="_blank">Webring</a> index.
Hopefully I will keep this updated this time around.</p>
<p>I am not a native English speaker, but I am constantly trying to
improve my language skills. I hope I can make it clear enough, but in
the case I don’t - please, do not hesitate to contact me and ask
questions or suggest relevant corrections.</p>
